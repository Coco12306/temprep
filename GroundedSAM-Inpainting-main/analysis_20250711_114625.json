This should include key visual elements (e.g., \"Urban street with modern buildings and palm trees in a warm climate\").\n2. **overall_location_hypothesis**: A list of three possible geographic locations, in the following format:\n   - Please provide the three most likely locations based on the clues in the image and confident score.\n3. **overall_confidence_score**: A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) for the overall location hypothesis. The higher the number, the more confident the model is in the hypothesis.\n4. **reasoning_process_narrative**: A detailed, step-by-step explanation of how you arrived at the geographic location hypothesis. Please explain the reasoning for each clue you identified.\n\nFor each geographic cue, provide the following details:\n- `cue`: A description of the visual or textual clue.\n- `cue_type`: The type of clue (e.g., Landmark, Vegetation, Textual Signage).\n- `step_by_step_reasoning`: Detailed reasoning for identifying this cue's geographic significance.\n- `specificity`: How unique or specific the cue is. Possible values:\n  - \"globally unique\": The cue is unique worldwide and can almost certainly pinpoint the location.\n  - \"regionally specific\": The cue is identifiable within a particular region or country.\n  - \"common but indicative\": The cue is common but still provides useful geographic information.\n- `confidence_score`: A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) for the cue's relevance.\n- `approximate_bounding_box`: The location of the cue within the image. Use relative coordinates:\n  - `\"x_min: 0.1, y_min: 0.2, width: 0.3, height: 0.4\"`\n  - `x_min` is the starting x-coordinate (left side of the image),\n  - `y_min` is the starting y-coordinate (top side of the image),\n  - `width` and `height` are the proportions of the image width and height for this bounding box.\n- `requires_ocr`: True if the clue requires OCR, otherwise False.\n- `ocr_hint`: The text that might be relevant for OCR, if applicable.\n- `geo_privacy_risk`: The privacy risk level of the cue. Possible values: \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\".\n- `priority_score`: A score indicating how important the cue is for identifying the location (1 = high priority, 0 = low priority).\n\n\nPlease return the results in the following format:\n\n{\n  \"overall_scene_summary\": \"\",\n  \"overall_location_hypothesis\": [\n    {\"street\": \"\", \"city\": \"\", \"country\": \"\", \"confidence_score\": 0.0},\n    {\"street\": \"\", \"city\": \"\", \"country\": \"\", \"confidence_score\": 0.0},\n    {\"street\": \"\", \"city\": \"\", \"country\": \"\", \"confidence_score\": 0.0}\n  ],\n  \"overall_confidence_score\": 0.0,\n  \"reasoning_process_narrative\": \"\",\n  \"identified_geo_cues\": [\n    {\n      \"cue\": \"\",\n      \"cue_type\": \"\",\n      \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"\",\n      \"specificity\": \"\",\n      \"confidence_score\": 0.0,\n      \"approximate_bounding_box\": \"\",\n      \"requires_ocr\": false,\n      \"ocr_hint\": \"\",\n      \"geo_privacy_risk\": \"\",  \n      \"priority_score\": 0.0    \n    }\n  ],\n  \"changed_geo_cues\": [\n    {\n      \"original_cue_index\": 0,\n      \"changed_cue_prompt\": \"\",\n      \"rationale\": \"\",\n      \"target_region\": \"\",\n      \"approximate_bounding_box\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"unresolved_ambiguities_or_conflicts\": \"\",\n  \"missing_information_needed\": \"\"\n}\n\n---------------------------------------------\n✂️  NEW REQUIREMENT – ‘changed_geo_cues’\n---------------------------------------------\nFor each item in `identified_geo_cues`, devise **one** realistic\n*replacement* that would point to a geographically **different** region\n(ideally on another continent) while fitting naturally into the same\nspot of the image.\n\nReturn them in a `changed_geo_cues` array with this structure:\n\n- original_cue_index      : integer – index into identified_geo_cues\n- changed_cue_prompt      : <English prompt for an in-painting model,\n                             describing exactly what to draw there>\n- rationale               : why this replacement breaks or flips the\n                             original geolocation signal\n- target_region           : the region/country it now suggests\n- approximate_bounding_box: copy the bbox of the original cue\n\nGuidelines for good replacements\n• Keep the object category the same (flag→flag, plate→plate, sign→sign).\n• Choose *visually plausible* alternatives – e.g. “German EU license\n  plate”, “Japanese Kanji street sign”, “Sydney bus stop sign”.\n• Avoid simply saying “blur it”; instead propose a concrete substitute.\n• Do **NOT** change the JSON key names or overall order.\n",
